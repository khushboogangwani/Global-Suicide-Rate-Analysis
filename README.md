# Global Suicide Rate Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global suicide rates using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The analysis is conducted using Python, primarily leveraging the capabilities of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others. The aim is to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and factors influencing suicide rates across different demographics and regions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the initial phase, extensive EDA is performed on the dataset using Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. Python scripts are utilized to preprocess, clean, and explore the dataset thoroughly. This step involves handling missing data, identifying outliers, and transforming variables as necessary to prepare the data for visualization and analysis.

## Dashboard Creation with Power BI
After data preprocessing, the cleaned dataset is uploaded to Power BI for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards. Two comprehensive dashboards are developed, showcasing various aspects of global suicide rates:

1. **Dashboard 1:**
   - Visualization of suicide trends over the years, providing insights into temporal patterns.
   - Analysis of suicide rates across different age groups, highlighting age-specific trends and variations.
   - Gender-based analysis depicting the distribution of suicides among males and females.
   - Examination of suicide rates by generation, uncovering generational disparities and trends.
   
2. **Dashboard 2:**
   - Presentation of the top 10 and bottom 10 countries based on suicide rates, enabling comparison and identification of high-risk regions.
   - Interactive map visualization showcasing the geographical distribution of suicides worldwide, offering a comprehensive overview of global trends and hotspots.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to contribute to a better understanding of global suicide rates and their underlying factors. By leveraging data analytics techniques and visualization tools, we aim to identify key trends, disparities, and potential drivers of suicide across different demographics and regions. This analysis can serve as a foundation for policymakers, researchers, and mental health professionals to develop targeted interventions and strategies aimed at reducing suicide rates and promoting mental well-being on a global scale.
